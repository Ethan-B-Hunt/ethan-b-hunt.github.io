                <h1>BOOK OF THE DAY</h1>
                <h2>Rhythm of War; by Brandon Sanderson</h2>
                <img class="book_img" src="img/dan_dos_santos_ishi_web.jpeg" alt="Wheel of time" width="45%">
                <p>Rhythm of war is a really great book; it's the 4th book in the Stormlight Archives. So far it's my favorite in the series. Definitely highly recommend reading.</p>

                <img class="book_img" src="img/5496487.jpeg" alt="the name of the wind">
                <P>Its a really good book, this book does have an interesting way of telling the story as it has the main character talking to another person about his life. Definitely highly recommended though.</P>

                <h1>BOOK OF THE MONTH</h1>
                <h2>The Wheel of Time Series; by Robert Jordan</h2>
                <img class="book_img" src="img/the-wheel-of-time-07.jpeg" alt="Wheel of time">
                <P>I know that we said book of the Month but the whole series is really good! It does take a little bit to get into them, and there are some books in the series that you could skip and still know what's going on. Even with that though this is probably one of my favorite series of all time.</P>
