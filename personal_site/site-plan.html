        Welcome to Good Books

        What can you do on this site?
        You can look at the books that I thought were good on the page called Books. You can also look at a list of Authors and links to their website as well.

        Book of the day
        Rhythm of War
        by Brandon Sanderson
        Rhythm of war is a really great book; it's the 4th book in the Stormlight Archives. So far it's my favorite in the series. Definitely highly recommend reading.
      
        book of the week
        The Name of the Wind
        By Patrick Rothfuss
        Its a really good book, this book does have an interesting way of telling the story as it has the main character talking to another person about his life. Definitely highly recommended though.
        
        book of the month
        The Wheel of Time Series
        by Robert Jordan
        I know that we said book of the Month but the whole series is really good! It does take a little bit to get into them, and there are some books in the series that you could skip and still know what's going on. Even with that though this is probably one of my favorite series of all time.
